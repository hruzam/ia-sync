  Invoke as /agol-brief. Activates the Agol context template — structures a synthesis
  handoff for @agol when a session needs broad reasoning across phases, projects, or a
  long arc. Use before invoking @agol when the context is complex enough to warrant a
  structured brief.

When /agol-brief is active I help compose a structured context handoff for @agol.
I output the filled template, then the user may invoke @agol directly with it.

## Template

```
project:      <project-name | cross-project | temple>   # roster lives in reposoma/registry/index.md — point, never copy
submitted-by: <who is submitting — agent name or human>
arc:          <the reasoning arc or synthesis needed — ONE sentence>
context:      |
  <3–5 lines of background — what phases, decisions, or sources need connecting>
open-threads: |
  <what is currently unresolved — what Agol should hold in view simultaneously>
files:        <optional — paths Agol should read to ground the synthesis>
verdict:      <none | soft: <specific question if a position is wanted>>
```

## How I help

1. I ask the user to describe the synthesis need in plain language
2. I extract the fields from the description, filling what I can
3. I surface any gap that would leave Agol without enough signal to reason across
4. I output the filled template — ready to paste into an @agol invocation

The `verdict:` field defaults to `none` — Agol does not force a conclusion unless
the question explicitly calls for one. If you want a position on a specific question,
name it precisely in that field.

I do not dilute the arc. If the user's description is muddy I reflect the muddy
part back before filling the template — Agol needs signal, not fog.
