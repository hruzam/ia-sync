name: buffering
description: Hold incremental, noisy, or voice-style input until the user intentionally signals feed-end, or run a creative substrate-to-architecture-to-execution design arc before releasing a durable artifact. Use when the user explicitly asks to buffer or hold, says more input is coming, invokes a creative triad, or requests exploratory design before implementation. Do not trigger merely because a request mentions a data feed or asks for an ordinary opinion.

# Buffering

Delay artifact release while the user's input or the design itself is still forming. Buffering
is a controller procedure, not a new agent identity and not a replacement for ordinary scoped
implementation after approval.

## Choose one mode

- **Intake mode** for fragmented, incremental, dictated, or explicitly unfinished input.
- **Creative mode** for opinion, architecture, design, or “what do you think?” requests where
  the user wants exploration before an artifact.

If the mode is unclear, keep receiving input and ask one short non-leading question. Modes may
transition during one cycle; the same buffer, `_underline_` threads, and release gate survive the
transition. Do not spawn one agent per phase. Delegate only a genuinely independent evidence task
permitted by the active repository.

## Intake mode

1. **Feed** — receive fragments, normalize obvious noise, and briefly reflect the current
   understanding. Mark unresolved threads as `_underline_`. Do not edit files or release the
   requested artifact.
2. **Synthesize** — begin when the user intentionally ends intake with `feed end`, `that's all`,
   or an equally clear phrase. Connect the buffer to local project truth and form one coherent
   proposal. Ending intake is not by itself approval to write.
3. **Smooth** — surface material ambiguity, disagreement, and the smallest safer alternative.
   Ask only questions whose answers would materially change the artifact.
4. **Draw** — after smoothing is accepted, produce or implement the authorized artifact using
   the applicable repository and skill gates.
5. **Close** — report the result and surface every remaining `_underline_` thread for continuation
   or parking in the repository-defined pulse/dock.

## Creative mode

1. **Substrate** — treat the request as a direction rather than a literal specification. Explore
   two or three materially different framings, weak signals, and the hidden constraint. Separate
   invention from observed fact; do not implement.
2. **Architecture** — map the strongest framing to concrete boundaries, flow, ownership, and
   failure modes. Reject unnecessary machinery and state the smallest sufficient shape.
3. **Execution** — offer the synthesis to @majkee. Conversational discussion of the proposal is
   allowed; “artifact” here means a durable file, external write, or implementation. Release or
   implement one only after approval, then follow the normal surgical change and verification gates.

## Invariants

- An explicit feed-end advances the cycle; silence or a plausible sentence ending does not.
- The user may cancel buffering or explicitly authorize immediate execution at any time.
- Buffer state is conversational and temporary. Only when repository instructions declare the
  surface and @majkee authorizes parking, route locks to its `flag.md`, live state to its single
  `pulse.md`, scratch to its declared dock, or exact interrupted-session context to a cold-start
  card. Otherwise make no durable continuity write.
- Do not create `cartan.pulse.md`, a vendor-specific project pulse, or a transcript dump.
- Preserve `_underline_` threads until the user continues them or authorizes parking them.

## Cross-runtime note

This single Codex skill preserves the semantic contracts of Claude's `buffering-cycle` and
`buffering-creative-triad`. The combined surface is intentional: Codex uses one controller-level
release gate with two modes rather than two resident procedures or additional agents.
